AI Interaction Overview
In developing the AllerTree landing page, our team primarily used FigJam AI as our generative AI tool and (AI) as an assistant. Figma played a central role in rapidly generating layout, content structure, and visual elements tailored to AllerTree—a platform focused on allergy management through tree pollen tracking and personalized health insights—while (AI) focuses on suggesting responsive design principles and refining copy for user engagement. 
Prompting Details
For landing page
Here are 3 specific prompts I used with Figma, along with summaries of the responses and their influence on the landing page:
Prompt: "Design a modern, family-friendly, health-tech landing page for **AllerTree** – Hong Kong’s first all-in-one child allergy prevention & family management app.   **Brand Identity & Style** - Logo: Tree icon with family silhouette inside, green (#2E7D32) + soft white (#F5F9F5) - Primary color: Calm forest green (#2E7D32) - Accents: Soft peach (#FF8A65), light mint (#A7D8C4), warm beige (#F5E6D3) - Typography: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Poppins), friendly & readable - Tone: Empathetic, proactive, science-backed, community-driven, Hong Kong-localized - Vibe: Trustworthy health app meets warm family support – not clinical, not childish  **Page Structure (Hero → Scroll-Down Sections)**  1. **Hero Section** (Full-width, mobile-first responsive)    - Background: Subtle Hong Kong skyline at dusk + faint green leaf overlay    - Headline: “Predict.

Premium family features available.”  **Design Notes for Figma AI** - Use real app screenshots from provided deck (predictor, scanner, recipes, restaurants, community) - Include subtle Hong Kong cultural cues (MTR colors, dim sum, wet market vibe) - Mobile-first: All sections stack cleanly - Micro-interactions: Hover on CTA → leaf animation - Accessibility: High contrast, large tap targets  Generate a complete, responsive, single-page Figma prototype with auto-layout, components, and realistic app mockups. the upload images are mascot ensure the poses of mascot are not repeated and not blocked"
Response Summary: Generated a full-width hero layout:
HeroSection - Full-screen hero with Hong Kong skyline background, mascot #1 (arms open pose), headline, CTAs, and trust badge
ProblemSolutionCards - Interactive flip cards showing HK allergy challenges and solutions
FeaturesShowcase - 5 detailed iPhone mockups displaying each core feature (risk predictor, scanner, recipes, restaurants, community) with mascot #2 as decoration
HowItWorks - 3-step process with connected flow and progress indicators
FamilyEcosystem - Tree diagram visualization with mascot #3 showing different age groups (children, teens, adults)
ScienceSection - Three pillars of technology with interactive risk gauge visualization
CommunityProof - Instagram Reels-style video cards with testimonials and #AllerTreeHK feed
FinalCTA - Final download section with all three mascots, app store buttons, and footer
Influence:
This single FigJam AI generation became the entire production-ready Figma prototype. Only minor spacing, animation timing, and asset swaps (real screenshots + final logo) were adjusted manually — the complete structure, visual hierarchy, copy, component system, and responsive behavior were used exactly as generated, saving weeks of manual design work.
Prompt: 
the first picture is my real logo replaced it with the attachment. The 2nd and 3rd attachments are other poses of my mascot to ensure there is no repeated poses of mascot in each page. The five features of the app introduction is too ugly better modify it. The Allertree Family Hub blocked one of the icon, please double check no icon are blocked. Our data are not trained by HK pediatric datasets but rather studies of allergy across all ages.The page with personalised rist management , the pointer blocked the risk score, better find ways to avoid it and the graphic of high risk number (67-100) is not as good looking as the low risk and moderate risk better fix the layout. Change JohnL's photo to a peanut free cafe rather than a view and change dr chan's photo to a family pic which is not same with sarah. Th ejoin the conversation layout is too ugly, try to immitate posts from instagram or reels to make it and ensure the pictures of the posts are not repeated, for example a post recommending a peanut free snack or collagen candies with many likes

Response Summary: This prompt gives a cohesive, professional design with all mascots properly distributed, accurate data statements, and a beautiful Instagram-inspired community section:
Real Logo - Replaced the SVG logo with your actual AllerTree tree logo image throughout the site
Different Mascot Poses - Used all three unique mascot poses without repetition:
Hero section: Arms-open mascot
Features section: Pointing mascot (decorative)
Family Ecosystem: Waving mascot
Final CTA: All three poses (pointing & waving on sides, arms-open in center)
Redesigned Features Showcase - Completely rebuilt with a modern card-based layout featuring alternating left/right layouts, elegant visual elements with gradient backgrounds, and clear benefit lists
Fixed Family Hub Tree - Repositioned the central hub and branch icons so nothing is blocked, increased spacing and adjusted z-index for proper layering
Updated Data Source - Changed from "HK pediatric datasets" to "studies of allergy across all ages" throughout
Fixed Risk Gauge - Score display now has white background and is positioned above the pointer, thinner pointer that doesn't block the score, improved high-risk segment styling with gradient from red to darker red
Updated Photos:
John L.: Changed to peanut-free cafe interior
Dr. Chan: Changed to different family dinner photo (not same as Sarah)
Redesigned Community Section - Created authentic Instagram-style posts with proper Instagram UI (header with username, image, action buttons, likes/comments), 4 unique posts showing: almond snacks, collagen candies, restaurant menu, food label checking, realistic engagement metrics and captions with #AllerTreeHK
Influence: The output from this prompt served as the final polish pass — every correction and enhancement (correct logo placement, non-repeating mascot poses, unblocked tree diagram, authentic Instagram-style posts, fixed risk gauge, accurate photos) was directly accepted and replaced the previous version, resulting in a pixel-perfect, stakeholder-approved design ready for developer handoff.

Prompt: “the function hould be ingredient scanner rather than barcode scanner and we have a new function called 'Health Tracker' in an existing allergy management app. This is a standalone function for tracking symptoms and triggers, with analysis and AI insights.”
Response summary: This prompt replace the barcode scanner section to ingredienmt scanner section
Font updated - Changed all fonts to Times New Roman with professional serif fallbacks (Times, Georgia, serif)
Barcode Scanner → Ingredient Scanner - Updated the feature name and icon (now using ScanLine icon instead of ScanBarcode)
Health Tracker feature added - New standalone feature with Activity icon, purple color (#9C27B0), and benefits including symptom logging, trigger identification, and AI-powered insights
Feature count updated - Changed from "4 Powerful Features" to "5 Powerful Features"
All sections synchronized - Updated Hero section subheadline and Final CTA features list to reflect the new feature set
Influence: This update was instantly applied across the entire prototype (hero subheadline, feature showcase, final CTA, app screenshots) and became the official final feature set. The switch to Ingredient Scanner + addition of Health Tracker made the value proposition significantly stronger and more accurate, directly influencing the App Store listing copy and marketing messaging moving forward.

Project Evolution
The AllerTree landing page was built entirely in FigJam AI through three prompts — from blank board to pixel-perfect, stakeholder-approved Figma prototype in under 4 hours. The first prompt generated the complete 8-section responsive layout, copy, mockups, and brand system in one shot — instantly replacing weeks of manual work. The second prompt polished everything: real logo, non-repeating mascot poses, unblocked tree diagram, authentic Instagram-style community posts, fixed risk gauge, and correct data — all applied perfectly in a single regeneration. The third prompt finalized the product truth by switching to "Ingredient Scanner" and adding "Health Tracker," automatically updating every section, mockup, and counter. FigJam cut the 3–4 week process down to a few hours while delivering client-ready quality landing page.
