# AI Interaction Overview
In developing the **AllerTree** landing page, our team primarily used **FigJam AI** as our generative AI tool and **(AI)** as an assistant. Figma played a central role in rapidly generating layout, content structure, and visual elements tailored to **AllerTree**—a platform focused on allergy management through tree pollen tracking and personalized health insights—while **(AI)** focuses on suggesting responsive design principles and refining copy for user engagement.

### 2. Prompt:
the first picture is my real logo replaced it with the attachment. The 2nd and 3rd attachments are other poses of my mascot to ensure there is no repeated poses of mascot in each page. The five features of the app introduction is too ugly better modify it. The Allertree Family Hub blocked one of the icon, please double check no icon are blocked. Our data are not trained by HK pediatric datasets but rather studies of allergy across all ages.The page with personalised rist management , the pointer blocked the risk score, better find ways to avoid it and the graphic of high risk number (67-100) is not as good looking as the low risk and moderate risk better fix the layout. Change JohnL's photo to a peanut free cafe rather than a view and change dr chan's photo to a family pic which is not same with sarah. Th ejoin the conversation layout is too ugly, try to immitate posts from instagram or reels to make it and ensure the pictures of the posts are not repeated, for example a post recommending a peanut free snack or collagen candies with many likes

   - Final CTA: **All three poses** (pointing & waving on sides, arms-open in center)
3. **Redesigned Features Showcase** - Completely rebuilt with a modern card-based layout featuring alternating left/right layouts, elegant visual elements with gradient backgrounds, and clear benefit lists
4. **Fixed Family Hub Tree** - Repositioned the central hub and branch icons so nothing is blocked, increased spacing and adjusted z-index for proper layering
5. **Updated Data Source** - Changed from *"HK pediatric datasets"* to **"studies of allergy across all ages"** throughout
6. **Fixed Risk Gauge** - Score display now has white background and is positioned above the pointer, thinner pointer that doesn't block the score, improved high-risk segment styling with gradient from red to darker red
7. **Updated Photos**:
   - **John L.**: Changed to peanut-free cafe interior
   - **Dr. Chan**: Changed to different family dinner photo (not same as Sarah)

### 3. Prompt:
delete the restaurants funtion,"Design a high-fidelity Figma prototype for a new mobile app feature called 'Allergy Tracker' in an existing allergy management app. This is a standalone function for tracking symptoms and triggers, with analysis and AI insights. The app already has other functions, so focus only on this new feature's screens and flows, integrating seamlessly with an existing navigation (e.g., add it as a tab or button in the main menu). Emphasize a calendar-based interface for tracking symptom strength over time.
Key screens and flows:
1. **Dashboard Screen for Tracker**: A dedicated dashboard within the feature, featuring a prominent interactive calendar view where users can select dates to log or view symptom strength (e.g., color-coded days: green for mild, yellow for moderate, red for severe). Include a quick-log button for new entries, summary stats (e.g., 'Most common trigger: Pollen'), and a graph correlating symptoms and triggers over the last 30 days. Tapping a calendar date shows that day's details. Include a prominent 'Analyze My Data' button and a disclaimer: 'Not medical advice – consult a doctor.'
2. **Log Entry Screen**: Form for logging symptoms (dropdown for types like sneezing, itching; slider for severity 1-10 to indicate strength; timestamp auto-filled). Section for triggers (multi-select from categories: food, environment, animals; custom text input). Add fields for notes, location (map integration), and photos (e.g., of rashes). Button to save and suggest 'Add to Analysis.' Automatically update the calendar with the logged symptom strength. Link back to main app navigation.
3. **Analysis Screen**: Visual analytics page with line charts showing symptom trends and strength over time (integrated with calendar data), pie chart for trigger frequencies, and correlation insights (e.g., '80% of hives occur after dairy intake'). AI insights section: Text box with suggestions like 'Possible cause: Food allergy. Try elimination diet, but see a doctor.' Always end with a 'Recommend Doctor' button linking to a booking modal.
4. **AI Suggestions Screen**: Triggered from analysis; input field for detailed symptom description. Output: Bullet points of possible solutions from a database (e.g., 'Antihistamines for mild symptoms'), with sources cited. Mandatory disclaimer banner: 'This is informational only. Schedule a doctor's visit.' Include an 'Export Report' button to generate a PDF summary, including calendar-based symptom strength data.
5. **Settings/Export Screen**: Options to export data as CSV/PDF for doctors (including calendar views of symptom strength), toggle AI features, and privacy settings. Integrate with existing app settings if applicable.
Overall design style: Modern, minimalistic with calming colors (blues/greens for health theme), large buttons for accessibility, dark mode support. Match the existing app's style guidelines. Use Material Design or Human Interface Guidelines. Include user flows: From feature entry point to calendar dashboard to log entry to analysis. Provide Figma file structure with frames for each screen, components for reusable elements like buttons and calendar widgets, and annotations for interactions."
